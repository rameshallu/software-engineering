Several famous web application attacks have highlighted the importance of web security and the potential risks associated with vulnerabilities in web applications. Here are some notable examples:

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**:

   - **Attack**: SQL injection attacks involve inserting malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters of a web application to manipulate databases or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
   - **Example**: The Sony PlayStation Network breach in 2011, where attackers exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities to access sensitive customer data, including names, addresses, and credit card information.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

   - **Attack**: Cross-site scripting attacks inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, or sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
   - **Example**: The MySpace worm in 2005, where an XSS attack spread a self-replicating JavaScript code through user profiles, causing the affected profiles to display a message and automatically add the attacker as a friend.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:

   - **Attack**: Cross-site request forgery attacks trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting malicious requests on web applications, leading to actions being performed on behalf of the user without their consent.
   - **Example**: The Samy worm on MySpace in 2005, where CSRF attacks were used to add the attacker as a friend, modify user profiles, and spread the worm to other users.

4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:

   - **Attack**: Distributed denial of service attacks flood a web application or server with a large volume of traffic or requests, causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.
   - **Example**: The Dyn DDoS attack in 2016, where a botnet of compromised IoT devices launched a massive DDoS attack against Dyn DNS infrastructure, causing widespread outages for popular websites and services, including Twitter, Netflix, and PayPal.

5. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**:

   - **Attack**: File upload vulnerabilities allow attackers to upload and execute malicious files on a web server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or server compromise.
   - **Example**: The Panama Papers data breach in 2016, where attackers exploited a file upload vulnerability in a content management system to leak millions of confidential documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca.

6. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
   - **Attack**: Remote code execution vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a web server or application, potentially leading to server compromise, data theft, or further exploitation of the system.
   - **Example**: The Equifax data breach in 2017, where attackers exploited an RCE vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data of approximately 147 million consumers.

These attacks underscore the importance of implementing robust security measures, conducting regular security assessments, and staying informed about emerging threats to protect web applications from exploitation and mitigate potential risks.
